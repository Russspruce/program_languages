KIF is similar to frame languages such as KL-One and LOOM but unlike such language its primary role is not intended as a framework for the expression or use of knowledge but rather for the interchange of knowledge between systems. The designers of KIF likened it to PostScript. PostScript was not designed primarily as a language to store and manipulate documents but rather as an interchange format for systems and devices to share documents. In the same way KIF is meant to facilitate sharing of knowledge across different systems that use different languages, formalisms, platforms, etc.	\N	\N	\N	[]

A notable and unique feature is its Open Type System, which allows the language to be easily extended to provide compile-time checking and IDE awareness of information that is typically checked only at runtime in most other languages. Also of note is the language's ability to serve as both a full-featured general purpose language and as a concise scripting language. For instance, Gosu has free-form Program types (.gsp files) for scripting as well as statically verified Template files (.gst files). Gosu can optionally execute these and all other types directly from source without precompilation, which also distinguishes it from other static languages.	\N	gosu-lang.org	1.10.1 / January 15, 2016; 3 months ago (2016-01-15)	[{"influences":"Kotlin"}]

Cornell also developed a compiler for the language that was based on its earlier CUPL compiler, and it was widely used in college-level programming courses. The two researchers and academic teachers who designed PL/C were Richard W. Conway and Thomas R. Wilcox.[1] They submitted the famous article "Design and implementation of a diagnostic compiler for PL/I" published in the Communications of ACM in March 1973, pages 169-179. PL/C eliminated some of the more complex features of PL/I, and added extensive debugging and error recovery facilities. PL/C is a subset of PL/I. A program that runs without error under the PL/C compiler should run under PL/I and produce the same results, unless certain incompatible diagnostic features, such as a macro section (begun by a $MACRO statement and finished by a $MEND statement), were used. The PL/C compiler had the unusual capability of never failing to compile any program, through the use of extensive automatic correction of many syntax errors and by converting any remaining syntax errors to output statements.	early 1970s (early 1970s)	\N	\N	[]

The language was originally conceived to teach concepts of programming related to Lisp and only later to enable what Papert called "body-syntonic reasoning" where students could understand (and predict and reason about) the turtle's motion by imagining what they would do if they were the turtle. There are substantial differences among the many dialects of Logo, and the situation is confused by the regular appearance of turtle graphics programs that mistakenly call themselves Logo.	1967; 49 years ago (1967)	\N	\N	[{"influences":"Lisp"},{"influences":"NetLogo"},{"influences":"Smalltalk"},{"influences":"Etoys"},{"influences":"Scratch"},{"influences":"AgentSheets"},{"influences":"KTurtle"},{"influences":"REBOL"},{"influences":"Boxer"}]

Obliq is an interpreted, object-oriented programming language designed to make distributed, and locally multi-threaded, computation simple and easy for the programmer, while providing program safety and implicit type system. The interpreter is written in Modula-3, and provides Obliq with full access to Modula-3's network objects capabilities. A type inference algorithm for record concatenation, subtyping and recursive types has been developed for Obliq, more important it has been proved to be NP-complete [1] and its lowest complexity to be Ο(n3) or if under other modeling up to certain conditions down to Ο(n2) [2] and its best known implementation runs in Ο(n5).[3] Obliq's syntax is very similar to Modula-3, the biggest difference being that Obliq has no need of explicit typed variables (i.e., a variable can hold any data type allowed by the type checker and if does not accepts one, i.e., a given expression execution error will be thrown) although explicit type declarations are allowed and ignored by the interpreter. The basic data types in the language include booleans, integers, reals, characters, strings, and arrays. Obliq supports the usual set of sequential control structures (conditional, iteration, and exception handling forms), as well as special control forms for concurrency (mutexes and guarded statements).

Napier88 was ahead of its time in many ways, and was the first robustly implemented language to combine a polymorphic type system with orthogonal persistence. The language was robustly implemented and released to users from both industry and academia; up to 1,000 registered users were recorded in due course. The language, however, was only intended to provide a proof of concept for an experiment in persistent programming; some time after 1989 (the year the first implementation was in fact released) the group's interests moved on and the language was no longer maintained.	\N	\N	\N	[]

ATS has support for combining theorem proving with practical programming through the use of advanced type systems.[1] The performance of ATS has been demonstrated to be comparable to that of the C and C++ programming languages.[2] By using theorem proving and strict type checking, the compiler can detect and prove that its implemented functions are not susceptible to bugs such as division by zero, memory leaks, buffer overflow, and other forms of memory corruption by verifying pointer arithmetic and reference counting before the program compiles. Additionally, by using the integrated theorem-proving system of ATS (ATS/LF), the programmer may make use of static constructs that are intertwined with the operative code to prove that a function attains its specification.	\N	\N	ATS2-0.2.5 / 2015-12-22	[]

522	Planner	No code example (yet).	Planner (often seen in publications as "PLANNER" although it is not an acronym) is a programming language designed by Carl Hewitt at MIT, and first published in 1969. First, subsets such as Micro-Planner and Pico-Planner were implemented, and then essentially the whole language was implemented as Popler by Julian Davies at the University of Edinburgh in the POP-2 programming language.[1] Derivations such as QA4, Conniver, QLISP and Ether (see Scientific Community Metaphor) were important tools in Artificial Intelligence research in the 1970s, which influenced commercial developments such as KEE and ART.	1969 (1969)	10.1.1.80.756	\N	[]
524	Microcode	No code example (yet).	A microassembler is a computer program that helps prepare a microprogram, called firmware, to control the low level operation of a computer in much the same way an assembler helps prepare higher level code for a processor. The difference is that the microprogram is usually only developed by the processor manufacturer and works intimately with the computer hardware. On a microprogrammed computer the microprogram implements the operations of the instruction set in which any normal program (including both application programs and operating systems) is written. The use of a microprogram allows the manufacturer to fix certain mistakes, including working around hardware design errors, without modifying the hardware. Another means of employing microassembler-generated microprograms is in allowing the same hardware to run different instruction sets. After it is assembled, the microprogram is then loaded to a control store to become part of the logic of a CPU's control unit.	\N	\N	\N	[{"influences":"Multithreading"},{"influences":"Temporal"},{"influences":"Simultaneous"},{"influences":"Preemptive"},{"influences":"Cooperative"},{"influences":"Flynn's taxonomy"},{"influences":"SISD"},{"influences":"SIMD"},{"influences":"MISD"},{"influences":"MIMD"},{"influences":"SPMD"},{"influences":"Addressing mode"},{"influences":"Digital signal processor"},{"influences":"GPGPU"},{"influences":"Microcontroller"},{"influences":"Physics processing unit"},{"influences":"System on a chip"},{"influences":"Cellular"},{"influences":"Address generation unit"},{"influences":"Arithmetic logic unit"},{"influences":"Barrel shifter"},{"influences":"Floating-point unit"},{"influences":"Back-side bus"},{"influences":"Multiplexer"},{"influences":"Demultiplexer"},{"influences":"Registers"},{"influences":"Memory management unit"},{"influences":"Translation lookaside buffer"},{"influences":"Cache"},{"influences":"Register file"},{"influences":"Microcode"},{"influences":"Control unit"},{"influences":"Clock rate"},{"influences":"Power\\nmanagement"},{"influences":"APM"},{"influences":"ACPI"},{"influences":"Dynamic frequency scaling"},{"influences":"Dynamic voltage scaling"},{"influences":"Clock gating"},{"influences":"security"},{"influences":"Non-executable memory (NX bit)"},{"influences":"Bounds checking (Intel MPX)"},{"influences":"Hardware restriction"},{"influences":"firmware"},{"influences":"Trusted Execution Technology"},{"influences":"Secure cryptoprocessor"},{"influences":"Hardware security module"},{"influences":"Hengzhi chip"}]

532	Java	// Hello World in Java\n\nclass HelloWorld {\n  static public void main( String args[] ) {\n    System.out.println( "Hello World!" );\n  }\n}	Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented,[13] and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA),[14] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.[15] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture. As of 2016, Java is one of the most popular programming languages in use,[16][17][18][19] particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.[citation needed] Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The language derives much of its syntax from C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.

An esoteric programming language (sometimes shortened to esolang) is a programming language designed to test the boundaries of computer programming language design, as a proof of concept, as software art, as a hacking interface to another language (particularly functional programming or procedural programming languages), or as a joke. The use of esoteric distinguishes these languages from programming languages that working developers use to write software. Usually, an esolang's creators do not intend the language to be used for mainstream programming, although some esoteric features, such as visuospatial syntax,[1] have inspired practical applications in the arts. Such languages are often popular among hackers and hobbyists.	\N	\N	\N	[]

In its fundamentals, PeopleCode syntax resembles other programming languages. Some aspects of the PeopleCode language, however, are specifically related to the PeopleTools environment. However, the fundamentals of objects and classes are the same as in Java language. Definition name references, for example, enable you to refer to PeopleTools definitions, such as record definitions or pages, without using hard-coded string literals.[1] Other language features, such as PeopleCode data types and metastrings, reflect the close interaction of PeopleTools and Structured Query Language (SQL). Dot notation, classes and methods in PeopleCode are similar to other object oriented languages, like Java. Object syntax was an important feature of PeopleTools 8.[2]	\N	\N	\N	[]

591	Citrine (programming language)	No code example (yet).	Citrine is a general purpose programming language for Unix-like operating systems. It focuses on readability and maintainability. Readability is achieved by syntactic and conceptual minimalism. The language is heavily inspired by Smalltalk and Self but has some very distinctive features. Like Smalltalk, Citrine treats everything as an object and focuses on sending messages to these objects. However unlike Smalltalk, Citrine lacks the concept of a class. In this regard, Citrine is more like Self and JavaScript because it uses prototypes. The combination of Smalltalk like messages and prototypes is what makes Citrine unique.	2014	citrine-lang.org	0.2 / 2014; 2 years ago (2014)	[{"influences":"implementations"},{"influences":"Smalltalk"},{"influences":"Self"}]
596	OpenCL	No code example (yet).	Open Computing Language (OpenCL) is a framework for writing programs that execute across heterogeneous platforms consisting of central processing units (CPUs), graphics processing units (GPUs), digital signal processors (DSPs), field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and other processors or hardware accelerators. OpenCL specifies a programming language (based on C99) for programming these devices and application programming interfaces (APIs) to control the platform and execute programs on the compute devices. OpenCL provides a standard interface for parallel computing using task-based and data-based parallelism.	\N	www.khronos.org/opencl	2.1 revision 23[1] / November 11, 2015; 6 months ago (2015-11-11)	[{"influences":"License"},{"influences":"www.khronos.org/opencl"},{"influences":"C99"},{"influences":"CUDA"},{"influences":"C++14"},{"influences":"Multiprocessing"},{"influences":"Memory coherency"},{"influences":"Cache coherency"},{"influences":"Cache invalidation"},{"influences":"Barrier"},{"influences":"Synchronization"},{"influences":"Application checkpointing"},{"influences":"Programming"},{"influences":"Models"},{"influences":"Implicit parallelism"},{"influences":"Explicit parallelism"},{"influences":"Concurrency"},{"influences":"Non-blocking algorithm"},{"influences":"Hardware"},{"influences":"Flynn's taxonomy"},{"influences":"SISD"},{"influences":"SIMD"},{"influences":"MISD"},{"influences":"MIMD"},{"influences":"Pipelined processor"},{"influences":"Superscalar processor"},{"influences":"Vector processor"},{"influences":"Multiprocessor"},{"influences":"symmetric"},{"influences":"asymmetric"},{"influences":"Memory"},{"influences":"shared"},{"influences":"distributed"},{"influences":"distributed shared"},{"influences":"UMA"},{"influences":"NUMA"},{"influences":"COMA"},{"influences":"Massively parallel computer"},{"influences":"Computer cluster"},{"influences":"Grid computer"},{"influences":"APIs"},{"influences":"POSIX Threads"},{"influences":"OpenMP"},{"influences":"OpenHMPP"},{"influences":"OpenACC"},{"influences":"MPI"},{"influences":"PVM"},{"influences":"UPC"},{"influences":"TBB"},{"influences":"Boost.Thread"},{"influences":"Global Arrays"},{"influences":"Ateji PX"},{"influences":"Charm++"},{"influences":"Cilk"},{"influences":"Coarray Fortran"},{"influences":"CUDA"},{"influences":"Dryad"},{"influences":"C++ AMP"},{"influences":"PLINQ"},{"influences":"TPL"},{"influences":"Embarrassingly parallel"},{"influences":"Software lockout"},{"influences":"Scalability"},{"influences":"Race condition"},{"influences":"Deadlock"},{"influences":"Livelock"},{"influences":"Starvation"},{"influences":"Deterministic algorithm"},{"influences":"Parallel slowdown"},{"influences":"Category: parallel computing"},{"influences":"parallel computing"}]

Common Intermediate Language (CIL, pronounced either "sil" or "kil"), formerly called Microsoft Intermediate Language or MSIL, is the lowest-level human-readable programming language defined by the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) specification and is used by the .NET Framework and Mono. Languages which target a CLI-compatible runtime environment compile to CIL, which is assembled into an object code that has a bytecode-style format. CIL is an object-oriented assembly language, and is entirely stack-based. Its bytecode is translated into native code or — most commonly — executed by a virtual machine.	\N	\N	\N	[{"influences":".NET Foundation"},{"influences":"DotGNU"},{"influences":"Microsoft"},{"influences":"Xamarin"}]
648	Objective-J	No code example (yet).	Objective-J is a programming language developed as part of the Cappuccino web development framework. Its syntax is nearly identical to the Objective-C syntax and it shares with JavaScript the same relationship that Objective-C has with the C programming language: that of being a strict, but small, superset; adding traditional inheritance and Smalltalk/Objective-C style dynamic dispatch. Pure JavaScript, being a prototype-based language, already has a notion of object orientation and inheritance, but Objective-J adds the use of class-based programming to JavaScript.	2008	Official website	\N	[{"influences":"JavaScript libraries"},{"influences":"Ajax frameworks"},{"influences":"JavaScript frameworks"},{"influences":"server-side JavaScript"}]

692	HTML	<HTML>\n<!-- Hello World in HTML -->\n<HEAD>\n<TITLE>Hello World!</TITLE>\n</HEAD>\n<BODY>\nHello World!\n</BODY>\n</HTML>	HyperText Markup Language, commonly abbreviated as HTML, is the standard markup language used to create web pages. Along with CSS, and JavaScript, HTML is a cornerstone technology used to create web pages,[1] as well as to create user interfaces for mobile and web applications. Web browsers can read HTML files and render them into visible or audible web pages. HTML describes the structure of a website semantically and, before the advent of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), included cues for the presentation or appearance of the document (web page), making it a markup language, rather than a programming language.	1993; 23 years ago	\N	\N	\N
